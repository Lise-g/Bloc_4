**Deep learning project for certification**

This project aims at building a spam detector for the AT&T company, that can automatically flag spams as they come based sollely on the sms' content.

## 1/ Building a deep learning model from scratch

> Notebook : 'deep_learning/project_spam_detector.ipynb'  

This notebook is used to build a simple deep learning model.  

In this notebook, the following steps are performed :  
- load the dataset
- perform EDA
- do preprocessing : clean the text (lower case, lemmatization, removing STOP words...) and tokenize the text
- build simpleRNN, GRU and LSTM models
- compare the results.

Please note that the lines of code for saving files were commented.

## 2/ Transfer learning

> Notebook : 'deep_learning/project_spam_detector_TL.ipynb'  

This notebook is used to train an already pre-trained model : small BERT for word embedding.

In this notebook, the following steps are performed :  
- load the dataset that was already cleaned in the 'deep_learning/project_spam_detector.ipynb' notebook. The clean dataset can be found at 'deep_learning/src/spam_clean.csv'.
- build the small BERT model with the matching preprocess model
- compare the results with the GRU model.


ðŸ‘‰ For each model that was trained, checkpoints were saved in order to be able to load the model at a given epoch. All the files can be found in the folders 'deep_learning/trainingRNN', 'deep_learning/trainingGRU', 'deep_learning/trainingLSTM', 'deep_learning/trainingTL'.  

ðŸ‘‰ All the saved models and their history can be found in the folder 'deep_learning/content'.
